## Bio

I am a Genomic Sciences student interested in evolution and bioinformatics as tools to understand how organisms evolve over time. Throughout my studies, I have developed skills in R, Python, and Bash for data analysis.

Currently, I am conducting a research internship at the Laboratory of Evolutionary Genomics at the Centro de Ciencias Genómicas, where we use microbiological techniques to investigate when, during the divergence of Rhizobium etli strains, the LuxI gene was acquired. This gene is involved in the synthesis of autoinducers that participate in quorum sensing.

Beyond science, I enjoy reading and spending time with my friends.
